    <p><strong>The Chairman is Mr. Simon.</strong></p>
    <p>
      This journey started on November 29, 2007.
      One day, Mr. Simon saw an elderly woman who had been hungry for several days.
      He gave her food to eat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon, many other people came asking for food.
      Mr. Simon thought, <em>how many people can one man help?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      They began seeking help from relatives and neighbors,
      but it was still not enough.
      Finally, they decided to ask for help from others — people like you. 🙏
